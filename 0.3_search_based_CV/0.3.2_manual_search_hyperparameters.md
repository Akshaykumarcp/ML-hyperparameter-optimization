# Manual Search
- Manual Search of Hyperparameters
- Different hyperparameters are set and experimented with
manually

# Manual Search - Uses
- Used to identify regions of promising hyperparameters
- To delimit the Grid Search
- Get familiar with the hyperparameters and their effect on the
models
- Establishing the benchmark model

# Manual Search - Limitations
- Lack of reproducibility
- Time consuming
- Does not explore the entire hyperparameter space
- Does not scale
