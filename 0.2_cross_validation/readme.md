Other places where CV is used:
- A better approach to feature selection is Cross-validation. It provides a more reliable way to choose which of the created models will best generalise as it better estimates of out-of-sample error. An advantage is that the cross-validation method can be applied to any machine learning model and the scikit-learn package provides extensive functionality for that.
- In regularization, the value of 位 is selected using cross-validation methods. A set of 位 is selected and cross-validation error is calculated for each value of 位 and that value of 位 is selected for which the cross-validation error is minimum.
