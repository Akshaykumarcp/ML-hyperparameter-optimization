# Parameters in ML models
- The objective of a typical learning algorithm is to find a function f that minimizes a certain loss over a dataset.
-  The learning algorithm produces f through the optimization of a training criterion with respect to a set of parameters

# Linear Regression Parameters

## Yi = β0 + β1X1i + β2X2i + ... + βnXni + ei

- b, the coefficients of the linear function, are the parameters to find or optimise by the algorithm

# Decision Tree Parameters
- The variable
- The split value
- The height in the tree

# Neural Network Parameters

- The weights at each neuron

# Hyperparameters in ML models
- Hyperparameters are parameters that are not directly learnt by the learning algorithm.
- Hyperparameters are specified outside of the training procedure.
- Hyperparameters control the capacity of the model, i.e., how flexible the model is to fit the data
- Prevent over-fitting

# Linear Regression Hyperparameters

## Yi = β0 + β1X1i + β2X2i + ... + βnXni + ei
- Vanilla Linear Regression
    -  no hyperparameters

# Regularized Linear Regression

- The regularization method:
    - Lasso
    - Ridge
    - Elastic net

- The regularization penalty

# Decision Tree Hyperparameters

- The metric to measure the quality of the split
- The number of features to evaluate at each node
- The depth of the tree
- The minimum number of samples required to split the data further

## Random Forests and GBMs
- Number of trees (or estimators)
- Learning rate (GBMs)

# Neural Network Hyperparameters

-  Number of layers
- Number of neurons per layer
- The activation function
- The dropout rate
- etc..

# Other model Hyperparameter
- Nearest neighbours:  the number of neighbour
- Support vector machines: the kernel function

# Hyperparameters in ML models
- Hyperparameters could have a big impact on the performance of the learning algorithm.
- Optimal hyperparameter settings often differ for different datasets.
- Therefore they should be optimization for each dataset
