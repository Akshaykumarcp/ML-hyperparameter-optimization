# Hyperparameter Optimization

# Parameters vs Hyperparameters

Parameters
-  Intrinsic to model equation
-  Optimized during training

Hyperparameters
- Defined before training
- Constrain the algorithm

# Random Forests and GBMs - Hyperparams

- Number of trees
- The depth of the tree
- Learning rate (GBMs)
- The metric of split quality
- The number of features to evaluate at each node
- The minimum number of samples to split the data further

# Hyperparameter Optimization
- The process of finding the best Hyperparameters for a given
dataset is called Hyperparameter Optimization or Hyperparameter Tuning.
- Method to choose the hyperparameters that minimize the
generalization error (not necessarily the loss)

# Hyperparameter Tuning: Challenges
- We canâ€™t define a formula to find the hyperparameters
- Try different combinations of hyperparameter and evaluate model performance
- The critical step is to choose how many different hyperparameter combinations we are going to test.
- As the the number of hyperparameter combinations increases, the chance to get a better model and computational cost increases
- How do we find the hyperparameter combination performance while diminishing computational cost
- Different hyperparameter optimization strategies

# Hyperparameter Tuning: Methods
- Manual Search (0.3.2 and 0.3.2.1 section of the repo)
- Grid Search (0.3.3 and 0.3.3.1 section of the repo)
- Random Search (0.3.4 and 0.3.4.4 section of the repo)
- Bayesian Optimization
- Others

# Hyperparameter Tuning: Search
A search consist of:
- Hyperparameter space (0.1 section of this repo)
- A method for sampling candidate hyperparameters (0.3 section of this repo)
- A cross-validation scheme (0.2 section of this repo)
- A performance metric to minimize (or maximize) 

# Hyperparameter response surface
- Find the hyperparameters that minimize (or maximize) a performance metric
- Hyperparams = min(performance metric)
